# UserPro [![HackerOne Bug Bounty Program](https://img.shields.io/badge/security-HackerOne-blue.svg)](https://hackerone.com/wordpoints)

Hello! This is where we develop the premium UserPro integration extension that you 
can [purchase on WordPoints.org](https://wordpoints.org/extensions/userpro/). 
The source code of the extension is made available here in good faith, to make it easier 
for developers to integrate with it, contribute bugfixes and security patches, and 
follow the development of new features. You can also feel free to use this source 
code to try the extension out before you buy it. However, if you decide to use the 
extension on a production site, we ask that you [purchase a license for it](https://wordpoints.org/extensions/userpro/), 
so that we can continue to provide updates and support for WordPoints and all of its 
great extensions. Thank you!
